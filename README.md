# Mango

Mango is an imperative programming language written in C++. This is my first language that I have written, and I am building it from the ground up (the lexer, parser, everything). My goal with Mango is to have a fun side project where I get to experiment and dive deeper into programming language creation. Other specifics have not been determined yet.
