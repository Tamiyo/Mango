# Mango
[Early Development] Mango is an imperative programming language written in Rust. This is my first language that I have written, and I am building the compiler from the ground up.

### NOTE
Currently moving to C++ to prototype some features, I might be considering using C++ fulltime until I research Rust more.

@func: a, b {
    print a + b
}

@func2: {
    print "hello!"
}
