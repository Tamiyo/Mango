Rexploring my primitive compiler journeys through https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/. <br>
Working through with help from https://github.com/Darksecond/lox <br>

This project is to help me learn Rust as well as to help build my understanding of compilers and virtual machines.
This project takes heavilty from Crafting Interpreters and Darksecond's implementation of the VM, with a slightly different grammar and rust flare.
