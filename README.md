# Mango Programming Language

## What is Mango?

Mango is a fun scripting language that I am developing in Rust.

Mango is the first programming language that I have ever made, (and I am also newish to Rust), so there will most likely be imperfections within the code. Nonetheless, Mango has been a very fun project to work on!

## A Lox Clone!

Mango derives heavily from the Lox language in [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. I have been following this book very closely during my implementation, with a few minor tweaks here and there to add more functionality to areas that I thought needed improvement.

Currently Mango has completed up until [Chapter 30](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/optimization.html) of [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) with a few little additions along the way.

## The Future of Mango

Mango's journey has been a long one. This project started over a year ago from writing this README in 2019 when I began to look into language creation. I took some classes at my school, fell in love with the idea of making a programming language, and dove into a few theorical textbooks on the subject. 

As much as I like working on the language, I don't know if I want to spend an exuberant amount of time optimizing it for consumer use at this time. I have a lot to learn about language creation before I can mold Mango into something "useful" to code in. I also have couple of other side projects I'm interested in such as creating a ray tracing renderer. 

As of writing this I'm graduating college with my bachelors and about to start a fulltime job in software development, and I also plan on going back to school while working in order to get a masters in computer science, so I'm about to get a lot busier :3. 

I don't know what will happen with Mango, I do find working on programming languages to be an __extremely__ fun pastime, so who knows? Maybe one day I'll make Mango into a full fledged programming language that I can feel comfortable using on a day-to-day basis.

Oh yeah... I made a [Trello Board for Mango](https://trello.com/b/VPZSVFDs/mango-programming-language), so if I do start to begin working on Mango again you can see my progress there.

## Acknowledgements

 Mango also takes HEAVY inspiration from [Darksecond's Lox Implementation](https://github.com/Darksecond/lox), so much so that many section of the code looks very similar. I am somewhat new to Rust and using Darksecond's implementation to help me understand the "Rust way of doing things" on many occasions and was a very helpful resource. It also helped provide a solid framework to build upon while converting the C based [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) code into Rust.

 I do not take any credit for original design on any parts of the language except those of which were not defined in [Darksecond's Lox Implementation](https://github.com/Darksecond/lox) or [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).
